üéÆ Hello and welcome! Thanks for checking out my panel. Here‚Äôs a bit about me: After years of hosting game servers, I became frustrated with the high costs, complex setups, and underwhelming features of existing panels. That‚Äôs why I created GSM.

As a solo developer, my focus with GSM is on functionality over appearance. While the design will evolve over time, my main priority is delivering a truly effective tool. GSM is not a web panel‚Äîyou'll need to install it and open it with the terminal. Keep an eye on GitHub or join my Discord for updates and announcements. With its user-friendly interface and features, GSM offers seamless control and monitoring of your servers. Enjoy easy setup, real-time server management, and mod handling, all designed to enhance your server administration experience. üåü
